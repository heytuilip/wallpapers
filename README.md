## Wallpapers

Repository full of nice wallpapers collected by me from the internet.
I don't own any of these wallpapers.

Some wallpapers are from these places:
1. https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers
2. https://github.com/BrodieRobertson/wallpapers
3. https://github.com/makccr/wallpapers
4. https://www.pexels.com/

I wasn't able to find original links of some of the wallpapers that were added earlier.
But from now I'll add them to the file [credits.txt](https://github.com/tuilipshrm/wallpapers/blob/master/credits.md).

Rest of them are collected by searching on Google.
